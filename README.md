# sifi_cms
This is for an assessment for tribehired that requires me to create rest api, so I figured to use this as sifi cms (content management system) in the future hence the name sifi_cms. Probably replacing the CMS that I am having right now, via www.sifi.my. This will be a quick dev. Thank you
